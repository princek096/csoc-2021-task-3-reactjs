## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Todo Application

There are three pages in this site.

- `/` - This is the main page where the user can create, edit or delete the tasks.
- `/login` - This is the login page.
- `/register` - This is the register page.

We have also created a backend server containing the API endpoints required for this application to function completely  - [https://todo-app-csoc.herokuapp.com/](https://todo-app-csoc.herokuapp.com/)

You are already familiar with API from last task if not find more details at [Task-2-Web](https://github.com/COPS-IITBHU/csoc-2021-task-2-web/blob/main/README.md#api-usage)

## Tasks
You would notice that the application is not functional completely. So, your task is to make it completely functional. There are several todos mentioned in the component files. You have to complete those.

In particular you have to

- **Auth middleware** - You may notice that initially you are landed on the main page even when you are not logged in. That is wrong. In [auth_required.js](./middlewares/auth_required.js) and [no_auth_required.js](./middlewares/no_auth_required.js) you have to add the logic for redirection based on he/she/them is authenticated or not.

- **Login Function** - Currently only register function works. You have to complete the [LoginForm](./components/LoginForm.js) function too present in Login.

- **Get Tasks function** - There is a function `getTasks` in [index.js](./pages/index.js). You would notice that even after logging in, you see a task *Sample Task 1*. This task was not created by you. This is a dummy task. You have to complete the `getTasks` function such that the tasks listed are the ones created by the user.

- **Add Task** - This functionality is present in [AddTask.js](./components/AddTask.js) which you have to complete by making API call and finally adding element to DOM.

- **Delete Task function** - This functions is present in the [TodoListItem.js](./components/TodoListItem.js) file. You have to complete it.

- **Update Task** - This functions is present in the [TodoListItem.js](./components/TodoListItem.js) file. To complete this you have to add in functionality `editTask` function which will render the dom for editing the list item. Finally complete the `updateTask` function.
